# Automated LCI Data Extraction
💫This repository provides an automated data extraction and matrix construction tool for databases such as Ecoinvent. It can directly process native EcoSpold v2 (.spold) files without relying on commercial software, automatically handling data parsing, cleaning, and standardization, and ultimately generating a sparse flow × process matrix.

With this workflow, researchers can:

Efficiently extract and integrate LCI data, avoiding the complexity and errors of manual handling;

Obtain a high-quality numerical matrix consisting of tens of thousands of processes and flows ;

Retain rich textual information to support semantic modeling and machine learning tasks;

Build a solid data foundation for missing data prediction and automated LCA analysis.



# Input and Output
**Input**
- EcoSpold v2 `.spold` datasets from the Ecoinvent 3.11 APOS release (drop them under `data/spold/` or point `ECOSPOLD_ROOT` to another directory).
- `FilenameToActivityLookup.csv` (semicolon separated) that maps file prefixes to activity names and locations (defaults to `data/FilenameToActivityLookup.csv`, override with `FILENAME_LOOKUP`).
- `batch_number.txt`, which stores the rolling batch ID (created automatically in `outputs/` unless you set `LCA_BATCH_FILE`).

**Output**
Each run creates a timestamped batch folder (`<output_root>/<MMDD>_<batch_number>/`) containing:
- A CSV per `.spold` file with cleaned intermediate and elementary exchanges (same basename as the source file).
- Logs and diagnostics: `processing_debug.txt`, `summary.txt`, `failed_files.txt`, and the spotlight lists `non1_amount_files.csv` and `neg1_amount_files.csv`.
- `global_activity_mapping.csv`, recording every activity ID discovered across the dataset.

The helper `build_lca_matrix` step then consolidates the per-activity CSVs into a sparse flow × process matrix and writes it to `LCA_MATRIX_TARGET` (defaults to the batch folder).

### Environment overrides
- `ECOSPOLD_ROOT` — directory that holds raw `.spold` files (default: `data/spold/`).
- `FILENAME_LOOKUP` — path to the lookup CSV (default: `data/FilenameToActivityLookup.csv`).
- `LCA_OUTPUT_ROOT` — parent directory for batch outputs (default: `outputs/`).
- `LCA_BATCH_FILE` — custom location for the batch counter file.
- `LCA_MATRIX_SOURCE`/`LCA_MATRIX_TARGET` — override the matrix builder’s input/output paths.
- `COMPARE_DIR1`/`COMPARE_DIR2` — set when using the directory comparison helper.


# 📝Run
## ⛏️Installation
We recommend using a virtual environment.
```
git clone https://github.com/CYouyouW/Automated-LCI-Data-Extraction-Protocol.git
cd Automated-LCI-Data-Extraction-Protocol
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ▶️ Running the pipeline
1. Place licensed `.spold` files under `data/spold/` (or export `ECOSPOLD_ROOT`).
2. Copy `FilenameToActivityLookup.csv` into `data/` (or set `FILENAME_LOOKUP`).
3. Launch the notebook (`JUPYTER_CONFIG_DIR=. jupyter lab`) and run `Automated_LCI_Data_Extraction_Protocol.ipynb` top to bottom.
4. Inspect the new batch folder under `outputs/` for CSVs, logs, and diagnostics.
5. (Optional) Rerun the matrix builder with `LCA_MATRIX_SOURCE`/`LCA_MATRIX_TARGET` to aggregate a specific batch elsewhere.

## Data Preparation

To run this project, you need to download the **ecoinvent 3.11** datasets (ecoSpold02 format). Go to the [ecoinvent website](https://www.ecoinvent.org/) and download **one of the following archives** (choose the system model you need):

- `ecoinvent 3.11_cutoff_ecoSpold02.7z`
- `ecoinvent 3.11_consequential_ecoSpold02.7z`
- `ecoinvent 3.11_apos_ecoSpold02.7z`

> ⚠️ Download **only one** of the three, depending on your application (cut-off, consequential, or APOS).

After extracting, you will get a folder named like:

- `ecoinvent 3.11_cutoff_ecoSpold02`
- `ecoinvent 3.11_consequential_ecoSpold02`
- `ecoinvent 3.11_apos_ecoSpold02`

Inside this folder you should see at least two subfolders:

- `datasets/` (contains `.spold` files)
- `MasterData/` (contains `.xml` files)

Place the extracted folder under the `data/` directory of this repository, for example:

```
project_root/
│
├─ data/
│   ├─ spold/                        # (symlink here if desired)
│   ├─ ecoinvent 3.11_cutoff_ecoSpold02/
│   │    ├─ datasets/
│   │    └─ MasterData/
│
└─ outputs/
```

Now you can run the processing scripts as described above.
